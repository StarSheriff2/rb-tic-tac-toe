## Introduction

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe
This is the classic game where you have to mark with an X or 0 your position in the board.
To play, each player will have to select a position in the grid by choosing a number from 1 to 9.
Each number corresponds to one of the positions in the grid. You can choose any position that is empty.
The first player to make a line of three consecutive marks wins the game.
The line can horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

The player who makes a straight line with 3 marks wins!
